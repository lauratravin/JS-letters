# JS-letters
The javascript code let you to submit word(I recommend no greater than 5 characters), and the program will create the word with example images where each images is clickeable. The page will tell you how many images do you need for your world. 



## Files

- Img folder: you must upload the images you want to use for you word. The amount of images must be equal to the number that the index.html shows when you test your word.
- The test images size is 400px x 400px, you can try other sizes but I recommend to use this size. Image has to be square in order to build the fonts properly.
